# AI Interface Prototype

A modern, polished frontend-only AI interface prototype built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Research

### Platforms Reviewed

**1. OpenAI Playground**
Advanced parameter controls with model selection, temperature sliders, and structured output generation. Features real-time prompt editing with generate buttons for automatic prompt creation and function definitions.

**2. Hugging Face Spaces** 
Open-source ecosystem with model comparison capabilities and collaborative workspaces. Emphasizes accessibility to diverse AI models with community-driven sharing and easy deployment of AI applications.

**3. Anthropic Claude UI**
Clean, conversation-focused interface with document upload capabilities and artifact generation. Features sophisticated context management with seamless chat experience and integrated file handling.

**4. TypingMind**
Multi-model support with advanced chat management, conversation branching, and custom prompt libraries. Offers local data storage and extensive customization options for power users.

**5. Microsoft Copilot Lab**
Task-oriented interface with contextual suggestions and integrated workflow tools. Features smart auto-completion and domain-specific optimizations for development environments.

### Core Features Selected

Based on analysis of leading platforms, I've selected these 8 essential features:

1. **Advanced Model Selector** - Dropdown with detailed model information and capabilities
2. **Smart Prompt Editor** - Rich text editing with template save/load and syntax highlighting
3. **Dynamic Parameters Panel** - Real-time sliders for temperature, max tokens, top-p, frequency penalty
4. **Interactive Chat Interface** - Streaming responses with copy, download, and regenerate options
5. **Theme System** - Sophisticated dark/light mode with system preference detection
6. **Template Library** - Organized prompt templates with categories and search functionality
7. **Responsive Layout** - Mobile-first design with adaptive sidebar and collapsible panels
8. **Accessibility Focus** - Full keyboard navigation, ARIA compliance, and focus management

## Design

### Key Implementation Notes

**State Management**
- React Context for global state (theme, settings)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Custom hooks for complex state logic and side effects



**Component Architecture**
- Functional components with TypeScript strict mode
- Props interfaces for all components with default values
- Composition over inheritance for flexible, reusable components
- Custom hooks for shared logic (useLocalStorage, useTheme, useChat)

**Accessibility Implementation**
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels and roles for complex interactions
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Cmd+Enter to send, Esc to clear)
- Focus management for modal dialogs and dynamic content
- Color contrast ratios meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards

**Performance Optimizations**
- React.memo for expensive re-renders
- Debounced parameter changes to prevent excessive updates
- Lazy loading for modal components and heavy features
- Optimized bundle splitting with Next.js automatic code splitting

### Known Limitations



### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Start production server

```





Each story includes:
- Default state examples
